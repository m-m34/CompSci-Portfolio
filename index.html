        <p>My favorite book is Looking For</p>
        <p>Alaska by John Green.</p>
        <img src="http://img2.imagesbn.com/p/9780142402511_p0_v3_s260x420.JPG" />
        <p>It is my favorite book because I love the story</p>
        <p>and her name but just that it is unpredictable and the</p>
        <p>characters are awsome and the author makes you feel like you are there and in a way you can relate to the characters.</p>
        <p>I read this book because one of my best friends</p>
        <p>let me borrow the book.</p>
        <p>My favorite movie is Breakfast at Tiffany's</p>
        <img src="http://cdn.pursuitist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Breakfast-at-Tiffanys-Wallpaper-Poster-Photo-4.jpg" />
        <p>This is my favorite movie because I love Audey and I love her character so much because she just does what she wants</p>
        <p>and doesn't care about what other people think.</p>
        <p>Favorite food is pizza from either Pronto or Pizza My Hear and I also love Mochi Ice cream. My favorite flavor is strawberry.</p>
