        <h1>My Vindinium</h1>
        <p>For this project we had to make a robbot in a video game move.</p>
        <p>We had to come up with as many commands as we wanted for our robbot but they had to work.</p>
        <p>I did no make many taskes for my robbot I just did two simple ones</p>
        <p>which were to go to a tavern when its health was lower than forty and when it wasn't doing that</p>
        <p>for it to get the free mines.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="SecondpartIMP" class="animate">
        <h1><em>How My Robbot Works!!</em></h1>
        <p>I first started by getting the key of my roobot.
        <p>I did this by using the link that was there and then just putting in a name and that would then give me a key to start with my roobot.</p>
        <p>After I had done that I was able to start creating the different tasks.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to make anything too complicated to I just did the two tasks wich were</p>
        <P>Geting health and the free mines.</P>

        <h1><em>My Code</em></h1>

        <p>This is wear I had to put the key and the link was in the code in order to make it esier to get the key.</p>
        <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/?ui=2&ik=dde29a3b40&view=fimg&th=14d9c4b375b164da&attid=0.1&disp=emb&realattid=ii_ia8nofyp0_14d9c4b21d31f694&attbid=ANGjdJ_uMBxC6MpKla46ZKQ2oDnOAQ3naxGsQVLr0ZhEhnZY4N20GFokoYASQO5TU7DqbWSPuEptkarwke4ZOOMu1_69Q4dEYP_RjpcuV5UcVpuwnVcpavjj2Ayue_c&sz=w890-h840&ats=1432846286676&rm=14d9c4b375b164da&zw&atsh=1" />
        <p>This part of the code are the tasks for the robbot.</p>
        <p>This will tell the robbot what to do and if it is not doing that then what else to do.</p>
        <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/?ui=2&ik=dde29a3b40&view=fimg&th=14d9c4ad76d31285&attid=0.1&disp=emb&realattid=ii_ia8nnvie0_14d9c4abbab78d89&attbid=ANGjdJ-duRSnNzc2CWH6bdh-NXGdy7MU50Ph76orAcEU80bDI7EXFTWqKuX8F3thr5kLyTAa2VJPI377cTHAjGHbak933JbC1D08ZxGj0P5Kjfh-YfAGb4KvBoAw5Pk&sz=w928-h416&ats=1432846261583&rm=14d9c4ad76d31285&zw&atsh=1" />
        <p>Not only do we need to make the code to tell the robbot what to do, but</p>
        <p>we also have to make the code to tell the robbot how it is going to do that task.</p>
        <p>This code tells the robbot how to get to the tavern and the robbot will analyse which tavern is the closest and with that information</p>
        <p>it will know what to do but more efficisntly.</p>
        <p>It would do the same thing with the free mines.</p>
        <img src="https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/?ui=2&ik=dde29a3b40&view=fimg&th=14d9c4a81ff4d8be&attid=0.1&disp=emb&realattid=ii_ia8nncdt0_14d9c4a590df2fd8&attbid=ANGjdJ_S9Ly9jG9hy12JiaqE0qwuJil4_4Rr_oFA-Tk-OMlwlWDPrI1HbcdM3pZs0uQDZ_D0O3gvHeMuoLUnijAA_S8mWr2zCOfzU0Hzwr817yV2UfVbEzUXt-56kuc&sz=w928-h246&ats=1432846240184&rm=14d9c4a81ff4d8be&zw&atsh=1" />
        <p>This peace of coed will set a direction for the robbot based on everything else that</p>
        <p>it has alredy done.</p>
